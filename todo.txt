Better Mass estimates for hot stars.
Get More accurate Bolo/TEff estimates for Hot Stars (PARTLY DONE)
Get More accurate Bolo/TEff estimates for Late K / M Dwarfs (PARTLY DONE)
Get Get More accurate Bolo/TEff estimates for L Dwarfs (PARTLY DONE)
Find a way to estimate Metallicity from Photometry.
TEffs, colors, and BCv for late K and M subdwarfs.
Check for oddities (ongoing)
Add extra photometry?
Better mass estimates in general. (MOSTLY DONE)
Update mass estimates for Subgiants (DONE)
Try to get better info/estimates for low mass white dwarfs.
Add ability to export parts of the list to a separate list.
Check for Pllx errors and Gaia companions.
